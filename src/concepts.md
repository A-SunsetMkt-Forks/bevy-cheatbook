# Appendix: General Concepts

This chapter teaches general knowledge, independent of Bevy. If you are new to
game development in general and don't understand some general concepts, there
might be something in this chapter to give you the background theory you need.

To learn how these things work in Bevy, the relevant pages (located elsewhere
in the book) will be linked on each page in this chapter.
